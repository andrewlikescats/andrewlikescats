<br/> you're probably here from the horse city game (https://pony.town) !! 
<br/> so here's some stuff I'd like you to know.

<br/> 1. i get really quiet so i'm sorry if i cant really keep a convo up;

<br/> 2. sometimes i space out and dont pay attention to things, please be patient.

<br/> 3. i'm dyslexic and type fast, so I have a hard time at both spelling and reading, i'll probably
<br/> ask you to repeat smth, i don't mean to be rude in any ways.

<br/> 4. PLEASE dont correct/mock my english when i mispell stuff, it makez me uncomfortable. (also a take 
<br/> back to topic 3. i have no control over what i type because most times i stumble on my thoughtz.)

<br/> 5. ***NO COPIES OR INSPIRATION FROM MY PONIES, FANGZ <3.***


<br/>  thatz about it, thank you for checking thiz out !! ♡
